Announcement: Advanced Custom Fields has temporarily been relocated to github!

== Description ==

Due to the new terms and conditions governing WordPress plugins, ACF  has been relocated to github. This will allow the plugin to be accessible whilst the new version is being built.

= New version =
The next version (V4.0.0) has undergone some major and exciting changes. This means that all Add-ons (premium code) will be stripped out of the core plugin and turned into 4 separate plugins. 

= Download =
* 3.5.8.1 (latest) - https://github.com/elliotcondon/acf/ 
* 4.0.0 (beta) - https://github.com/elliotcondon/acf4

The more people who can help out by testing the beta, the sooner we can release this exciting version back onto the WordPress repository. 

I apologise for any inconvenience this causes to you and your projects, however, unfortunately this is out of my control, and I can ensure you I am working hard to have this plugin back at your fingertips and better than ever!
