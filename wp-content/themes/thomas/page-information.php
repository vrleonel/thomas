			<h4>My name is Thomas Hooper.</h4>
			<p>Thank you so much for visiting my website and looking at my work. 
			I was born in Hastings East Sussex, studied tattooing at Good Karma under Jim Macairt, 
			studied Drawing at The London Institute of Art & Design, subsequently moving from London 
			to New York City to pursue my goals in Tattooing and Art.</p>

			<p>I work out of Saved Tattoo in Brooklyn NY. <br>
			Please contact me there at</p>

				<p>
				 I am currently not booking new clients for tattoo work. I am very grateful for the 
				 people who want to get tattooed by myself and are willing to wait, without YOU / the client,
				 my work would be nothing more than a dream. There are only so many hours in each day and I am 
				 unfortunately unable to accommodate each inquiry and request. If you would like to get 
				 tattooed by me in the future then please call Saved and they will give you any relevant information.
				</p>
				<p>
					I try my best to answer all emails, but it is difficult sometimes to get back to everyone. 
					If I don’t return your email please don’t hesitate to resend, they got lost quite easily, my 
					current response time for emails is about 4-6 weeks as I handle all of this personally and it 
					takes a long time to work my way through them between drawing and tattooing.
